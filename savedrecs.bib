Title = {All-organic polymer dielectrics prepared via optimization of sequential
   structure of polystyrene-based copolymers},

Abstract = {It is a great challenge to improve simultaneously the permittivity
   (epsilon(r)) and breakdown strength of polymer dielectrics. The linear
   polystyrene (PS) has the advantages of low cost, easy processing and
   high charge-discharge efficiency (eta). However, the low epsilon(r) and
   low breakdown strength result in the low discharge energy density (U-e)
   of PS. For polar liquid crystalline polymer
   poly{[}11-((4'-cyano-{[}1,1'-biphenyl]-4-yl)oxy)undecyl methacrylate]
   (PCBMA), it shows the merit of high epsilon(r), low band gap width and
   good film-forming property. In this paper, random copolymers
   P(St-co-CBMA) and block copolymers PS-b-PCBMA were synthesized by
   radical polymerization and reversible addition-breaking chain transfer
   polymerization, respectively. The effect of sequential structure on the
   dielectric behaviors and energy storage properties of polystyrene
   copolymers is investigated in detail. The experimental results indicate
   that a high epsilon(r) value of 5.2 (+/- 0.049), an outstanding U-e of
   8.94 J/cm(3) and high eta of 87.4\% at 476 MV/m are achieved in random
   copolymer P(St-co-CBMA) with the 92 mol\% content of CBMA unit because
   of the strong orientation polarization, deep traps and good film-forming
   property. This work demonstrates that it is a feasible strategy to
   obtain high performance polystyrene copolymer dielectrics via tailoring
   sequential structure between functional monomer and styrene monomer.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR STRUCTURE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {1243},
Month = {NOV 5},
Abstract = {Polystyrene (PS), when used as a substrate, reacts with acetyl chloride
   through the Friedel-Crafts mechanism to yield fluorescent acetylated
   polystyrene. Different acetylated polystyrene microspheres can be
   obtained under different experimental conditions. The fluorescence of
   acetylated polystyrene is observed via fluorescence microscopy, while
   the quantum yield of acetylated polystyrene is determined using a
   steady-state transient fluorescence spectrometer. The surface morphology
   is observed via scanning electron microscopy, and the chemical
   composition and structure are investigated by Fourier infrared
   spectroscopy, ultraviolet spectrophotometry, X-ray diffraction, and
   nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Finally, the optimal reaction
   conditions are determined as follows: carbon disulfide (CS2, 35 mL),
   aluminium chloride (AlCl3, 1.161 g), acetyl chloride (AC, 1.171 g),
   soaking time of 12 h, temperature of 50 degrees C, and water bath for 5
   h. Under these conditions, the acetylated polystyrene exhibited obvious
   fluorescence, with good fluorescence stability and coverage.
   Furthermore, it exhibited acid and alkali resistance, low-temperature
   resistance, and light resistance, and did not produce fluorescence
   leakage. In addition, it could be used as a tracer in organisms. (C)

Abstract = {Herein we present a study on the formation of irreversibly adsorbed
   layer of polystyrene molecules on silicon oxide surfaces. Various
   scanning probe microscopy techniques have been employed to study both
   the morphology and the mechanical properties of these self-assembled
   thin polymeric layers. More in detail, standard contact mode, force
   versus distance spectroscopy and ultrasonic force microscopy have been
   employed to obtain spatially-resolved maps and, thus, observe the
   physisorption of polystyrene on native silicon oxide substrate in
   function of time. Thick films, spin coated from a toluene solution, have
   been annealed at a temperature above the glass transition for increasing
   time intervals, and finally thoroughly rinsed in toluene. We have found
   that isolated islands of adsorbed chains are already present after an
   annealing time of half an hour. Prolonged annealing determines a
   progressive increase of the covered areas, whereas the formation of a
   complete flat layer requires 24 h. The pattern observed is in line with
   expected evolution of an unstable system, corresponding to the
   phenomenon of spinodal dewetting. Adhesion measurements show that the
   films present a reduced snap-off and the formation of a meniscus between
   tip and surface for annealing time up to 8 h. On the other hand, elastic
   measurements allow us to observe a progressive increase of the elastic
   modulus, with a complete transition for annealing time above 20 h. This
   is indication that a dense packing of the polystyrene molecules occurs,
   in line with the predictions of current models on the kinetics of
   irreversible adsorption. Lay Description Herein we present a study on

Abstract = {The surface morphology of polystyrene thin films formed from various
   molecular weight polystyrene and solvent conditions is studied. When
   spin-cast from tetrahydrofuran (THF) wrinkles are formed at the
   extremities that have periodicity with wavelengths in the {[}tm range
   and amplitudes in the nm range but varies with molecular weight. A mixed
   solvent system consisting of THE and dimethylformamide (DMF) leads to
   periodic structures only with THE-rich compositions. THE and DMF have
   similar properties relevant to spin-casting: density, surface tension,
   molecular weight, and viscosity but different boiling points and room
   temperature vapor pressures, demonstrating that formation periodicity
   requires a volatile solvent. The formation of the surface structures is
   attributed to the Marangoni effect and the film thicknesses and wave
   parameters are shown to be consistent with literature models.},

Abstract = {The wall structure separating floor areas significantly contribute the
   weight of the building that put it into a greater risk to earthquake
   event. The use of lighter wall materials is more desirable to reduce the
   potential risk of damage due to earthquake treat. This development of
   polystyrene wall panel is an effort to achieve two objectives, namely
   development light wall material and promoting green construction
   materials by utilizing polystyrene waste. The paper present the study on
   the development of polystyrene waste wall panel by pre-compacted method.
   In this research, the shredded polystyrene was blended with cement
   Portland and water at various certain proportion. When the mixed already
   properly blended, it was poured into the steel mold of 30x80cm. The
   mixed within the mold was subjected to compaction stress for up to 2 MPa
   that reduce the thickness of the mixed into about 1 cm. The polystyrene
   panel was kept in the humid zone for curing for about 28 days. They were
   12 wall panel specimens made for this purpose. Result of test show that
   at the same compaction stress, higher cement content produces stronger
   polystyrene concrete. The average compressive strength of specimens with
   250 kg/m(3) and 300 kg/m(3) cement content are 4.9 MPa and 5.3 MPa,
   respectively, and for flexural strength are 2.4 MPa and 3.3 MPa,
   respectively. The result show that the compressive strength of concrete
   matrix and flexural strength panel are significantly high. However,
   under repeated loading of about 10\% of maximum load, the panels
   experience decrease in stiffness in each load cycles suggesting the low
   tensile capacity of the concrete matrix. These results indicate the
   potential use of polystyrene wall panel for construction materials
   purposes with further attention on improvement the tensile
   characteristic of the concrete matrix. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published

Abstract = {A superabsorbent composed of waste polystyrene, starch, and acrylic acid
   was prepared through emulsion polymerization. The effects of major
   factors such as starch, acrylic acid, initiator, crosslinker, and
   bentonite contents and the neutralization degree of acrylic acid on
   water absorbency were investigated to obtain optimum conditions with
   high swelling capacity. The superabsorbent hydrogel was characterized by
   scanning electron microscope (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
   spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The FTIR results
   confirmed that the grafting polymerization took place among the
   polystyrene, acrylic acid, starch, and bentonite. The introduction of
   bentonite particles into the polystyrene-g-poly (acrylic acid)-co-starch
   system could increase the water absorbency. The superabsorbent composite
   containing 3 wt \% bentonite had the highest water absorbency (500 g/g
   in distilled water and 49 g/g in 0.9 wt \% NaCl solution). (c) 2012

Abstract = {Migration of potentially toxic substances from plastic packaging
   materials is very important in the food industry since it determines the
   suitability of polymers when used in food packaging. In this work,
   results are presented on the migration of styrene monomer from plastic
   packaging based on either rigid or foamed polystyrene. Water,
   ethanol/water solution and isooctane (resembling oil) were considered as
   food simulants. Experiments were carried out at various temperatures and
   migration was tested from 30 min to 30 days. Measurements were carried
   out using gas chromatography with external calibration and styrene
   standard solutions. No styrene was measured in water, except at high
   temperatures and long time periods, while the amount in ethanol/water
   was always grater than that in isooctane. Finally, the styrene diffusion
   coefficients for all the various experimental conditions were estimated
   using a rigorous model based on the Fick diffusion equation and the
   partitioning of the monomer between the two phases and consequently the
   activation energy of the migration process was evaluated. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {Atactic polystyrene, one of the most widely used chemical products, was
   subjected to novel chemically oxidative treatments able to trigger a
   great variety of physical and chemical changes in the polymer's chains.
   The oxidized polystyrene samples, when analyzed with Fourier transform
   infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) clearly showed the formation of carbonyl
   groups and hydroxyl groups, which increased with the increase in the
   strength of chemically oxidative treatments.
   In fungal degradation tests deploying Curvularia species, the fungus
   colonized the oxidized samples within 9 weeks. Colonization was
   confirmed by microscopic examination, which showed that the hyphae had
   adhered to and penetrated the polymer's structure in all the treated
   samples. Such colonization and adhesion by microorganisms are a
   fundamental prerequisite for biodegradation of polymers. (C) 2007

Abstract = {Polystyrene (PS) has brought in vitro cell culture from its humble
   beginnings to the modern era, propelling dozens of research fields along
   the way. This review discusses the development of the material,
   fabrication, and treatment approaches to create the culture material.
   However, native PS surfaces poorly facilitate cell adhesion and growth
   in vitro. To overcome this, liquid surface deposition, energetic plasma
   activation, and emerging functionalization methods transform the surface
   chemistry. This review seeks to highlight the many potential
   applications of the first widely accepted polymer growth surface.
   Although the majority of in vitro research occurs on two-dimensional
   surfaces, the importance of three-dimensional (3D) culture models cannot
   be overlooked. The methods to transition PS to specialized 3D culture
   surfaces are also reviewed. Specifically, casting, electrospinning, 3D
   printing, and microcarrier approaches to shift PS to a 3D culture
   surface are highlighted. The breadth of applications of the material
   makes it impossible to highlight every use, but the aim remains to
   demonstrate the versatility and potential as both a general and custom
   cell culture surface. The review concludes with emerging scaffolding
   approaches and, based on the findings, presents our insights on the
   future steps for PS as a tissue culture platform.},
