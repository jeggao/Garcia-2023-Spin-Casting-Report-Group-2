Abstract = {The density profiles of polymethylmethacrylate ( PMMA) thin films on
   silicon (111) single crystal wafers were investigated via neutron
   reflectivity measurements. Films were prepared by spin casting PMMA onto
   silicon wafers from o-xylene solution followed by annealing under vacuum
   at 90 degrees C for 5 h. A similar to 45 A thick layer at the free
   polymer surface was observed in the as-prepared samples that has a
   density about half the value of bulk PMMA. After heating above 110
   degrees C, this diffuse layer disappeared and the thin film density
   profile was transformed to one with a sharp free polymer surface. This
   transition was found to be irreversible. (C) 1994 John Wiley and Sons,
